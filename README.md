**ECS-Strawman** is a small sample project for Unity ECS (Entity Component System).
It is a custom Demo project based on keijiro's main repos that I shamelessly stole and adapted with a multistep comparison.
The main aim of the project is to show the basic structure of Unity ECS, so it avoids the use of its complex features.

The original tutorial video is available on YouTube.
